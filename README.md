# gitpod-nextjs-typescript-template
A template for using Next.js in Gitpod for development.

This repo was created as an example for the blog post [Faster Development environments with gitpod.io](https://theoptimisedwb.com/posts/2022-12-06-faster-development-environments-with-gitpod)

## Steps used to create this starter

1. Create a new repo & open it in Gitpod.io
2. Run `npx create-next-app@latest` in the terminal to create the base project from the Next.js templates
3. `yarn dev` to start the project


---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
